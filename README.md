# Theme Claim

### WIP
Rename a WP theme with a couple simple command line steps.

For testing:
* Clone or drop the theme-claim folder into the root of your theme. 
* Look at `/conf.json` and make sure it matches your current theme data exactly _(this is the data you're wanting to change)_.
* In the terminal, from the theme-claim directory, run `yarn start` or `npm start`.
